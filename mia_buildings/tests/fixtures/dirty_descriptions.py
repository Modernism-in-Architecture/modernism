    """<p>1018 flats in four different types of houses were finished. The biggest flats with four bed rooms have a living space of maximum 80 square metres, the smaller with two bedroom apartments 50 square metres. Each architect was able to plan his own flat sections. Mebes &amp; Emmerich and Adolf Muesmann developed flats with four rooms, Max Fricke and Johannes Koppe, which are the architects of the two interior blocks, designed flats with three rooms. Very untypical in comparison with other apartment buildings of that time, that no attics and classical cellars were built. When visiting the settlement, it is noticeable that the most of the paths are lower on the eastern side of the blocks and the meadows next to it much higher. This saved money for a deeper excavation. Wash houses and storage rooms (called the cellars) were built in the basement floors instead of cellars. At the top of the houses the flat roofs were all built with a pumice blocks by the company Philipp Holzmann A.-G., a new material in the building industry at the time. All houses are masoned.</p>
<p>The Krochsiedlung was planned according to the newest trends as an open area. The architects did not use closed blocks and it might be interpreted as an invitation to walk from all sides into and through the housing estate with its inner courtyards.</p>
<p>The four rows of blocks were designed by the four architects respectively by the architectural office. The four rows differ in their architectural structure; they all have different doors, windows and balconies or loggias. However, all flats are designed with a balcony or loggia. All the houses have the staircases on the east side and the balconies and loggias on the west side and in some houses also on the south side.</p>
<p>The southern row along Max-Liebermann-Str. and the western row from the junction of Landsberger-Str./Max-Liebermann-Str. along Landsberger Str. to Beyerleinstr. were built by Mebes &amp; Emmerich. The following, inner row of blocks towards the north were designed by Max Fricke. This is followed by the the 3rd row of blocks by Johannes Koppe. To the north is the 4th row of blocks by Adolf Muesmann. The paths in the south-north direction were always slightly offset, except between the 3rd and 4th row. That might soften the overall picture of the housing estate.</p>
<p>We present the four different house types in detail, ordered from south to north.</p>
<p>The southern row along Max-Liebermann-Str. and the four western blocks along Landsberger Str. were built by Mebes &amp; Emmerich. The southern and western blocks have the staircases on the east side. The original metal window frames have been preserved. On the west side are the loggias. On Max-Liebermann-Str., the last loggias are located at the south-western corner of the blocks, resulting in an interesting rhythmisation of the architecture.</p>
<p>On the west side along Landsberger Str., the four blocks are intersected in the middle by Nordernayer Weg. This results in a small gateway situation leading from Landsberger Str. into the inner parts of the house estate. The four western blocks are offset from each other giving this part of the housing estate a light touch.</p>
<p>Max Fricke used for his houses in the 2nd row a very striking design for the entrances. The staircases are less highlighted than the ones from Mebes &amp; Emmerich.</p>
<p>Walking along the north-south paths, immediately the loggias of the 3rd row of blocks from Johannes Koppe are catching the eyes. These loggias are situated on the southwestern fa&ccedil;ade, most of them at the western part of the houses. The make probably those blocks the most stylish of the entire housing estate.</p>
<p>The 2nd and 3rd row have in common a small building in the north facing west, whose staircases were designed to face north.</p>
<p>All three house types from Mebes &amp; Emmerich, Max Fricke and Johannes Koppe have balconies or loggias on the west sides and these protrude from the fa&ccedil;ade base. On the east sides of all these houses in the first three rows are the staircases, which also protrude architecturally.</p>
<p>In the 4th row to the north, no loggias were placed in front of the buildings, but within the basic form of the house but balconies were connected to the kitchen. The staircases also did not get a resalit-like structure, like the other three types of houses. The blocks of the 4th row by Adolf Muesmann are the simplest of all in terms of their external appearance.</p>
<p>Very progressive for the time was the fact that the entire complex was supplied by seven heating plants. They were arranged between the blocks and were fuelled with coke from hard coal. Since hard coal was not available for the Soviet occupation zone after the war, a central power plant was built in 1947 on the north-eastern edge of the settlement. It was fuelled by lignite, available in rough quantities on the territory of the GDR. This heating plant has been preserved in ruins. Today's heating plant stands next to it.</p>
<p>In comparison with other Leipzig housing estates, rents in the Krochsiedlung were about a third higher than the average rent. The price of a three bed room apartment 85 Reichmarks, of a four bed room apartment 100 Reichsmarks. That is why mostly people from the middle class lived here.</p>
<p>Between the blocks on the south side are single-storey buildings that house(d) shops.</p>

This project is the only one in which the architect did not use any decorations. However, the construction of the houses was done in a traditional way and no standardized production was used.</p>
<p data-block-key="rgc7y">The ideas of more light and green were implemented into this complex. The houses with flat roofs never stand as blocks and therefore have openly accessible courtyard areas. 5 of the 24 blocks were destroyed in World War II. In the 1980s, the Rundling was listed as a historic monument. The housing company LWB renovated the old stock and rebuilt the destroyed 5 houses after the year 1990. The new houses can be distinguished very well from the old ones. Although they are the same height, the new houses are painted in a strikingly dark yellow. The upper floor of the new houses was designed as apartments. In the old houses the upper floor served as a drying floor for the residents' laundry. The new houses have been given an underground car park, the entrances are clearly visible next to the houses. In contrast to the characteristic displays for the house numbers, more simple, flat displays for the house numbers were attached to the newly built houses. The windows of the apartments also differ. While the old houses have glazing bars in the windows and the kitchen windows consist of three parts, the new houses have glazing bars just in the front sides and one single window in the kitchen.</p>
<p data-block-key="04t4h">The entire complex now has 1.073 apartments. The apartments are designed as two-bedroom apartments with about 44 square metres, three-bedroom apartments with about 62 square metres and four-bedroom apartments with 80 square metres. In the two-bedroom apartments the bathroom is placed in the middle of the apartment (with no windows), in the three-bedroom apartments the bathroom is adjacent to the balcony.</p>
<p data-block-key="naf7o">The inner ring consists of four-storey buildings. They are the tallest buildings in this housing estate, so that the inner ring at the highest point of the hill can be seen as the hierarchical centre of the complex. The top loft is smaller than that of the houses in the middle and outer ring, to create open terraces. The facades of the inner ring face the central square without balconies. All balconies are facing the middle ring. This is an exception, because care was taken with the middle and outer ring that the balconies never lay north. That is why the balconies in the two outer rings face east, with priority towards south and west. This gives the two outer rings a lively and non-uniform facade design.</p>
<p data-block-key="k6vcw">The central square was originally equipped with a little swimming pool for children. Nowadays there is an overgrown round flower bed.</p>
<p data-block-key="g0elb">3 other buildings are added to the system. At D&uuml;rrstra&szlig;e 69, 71, 73 and Brunhildstra&szlig;e 1, 3, 5 there are 2 two-storey, straight buildings that have shops on the ground floor. The upper floor is used for apartments. The block Brunhildstra&szlig;e 2 and 4 deviates significantly from the other buildings in its overall concept. The building has three floors and has a round shop on the right. All 3 buildings serve as a gate or an entrance situation that lead to the settlement.</p>

Due to this solution the 7th and 9th floors received balconies. The continuous window strips on each floor allow a maximum illumination of all rooms, a basic principle of Baťa shoe stores.

<p>In the broadest sense, one of the most important core theses of the reformer Jan Hus (15th century) was realised in this place. The return of wine to the church community. Of course, in the theological sense this happens in the congregation hall, but also in the secular sense visitors of this place can enjoy wine, other drinks or even food in a restaurant of this multifunctional building. For us it is a big sensation.</p>

But then there were problems and fights. The city council withdrew its permit. However, the problems were solved and the building permit was granted again on September 24, 1928. On November 11, 1928, a religious community and numerous guests gathered, and after a common prayer, construction was inaugurated.<br />Everything seemed clear. But the completely unusual cold winter of 1928/29, with severe frosts from the beginning of December to the end of March, caused a delay of almost 4 months. Then the owner of the opposite houses filed a lawsuit against the construction, but even these problems were later overcome. Commissioning took place on August 30, 1929, and on the day of the grand opening on October 28, 1929 (then it was the 11th anniversary of the founding of the republic), to the amazement of the guests, everything was done "up to the last nail".

The lamps were mounted on the ceiling as illuminated strips, which is a bit reminiscent of an illuminated tram or underground and gives the church a truly modern appearance.

    """<p>This housing estate is Berlin&#x27;s first large modern one. The two architects Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner implement the principles of modern construction. air, light and green.</p><p>Bruno Taut wanted people to live safe and healthy, but above all happy. An expression of happiness are the intense colours he used in this settlement, but also for many other projects. When walking and discovering, this colour experience is certainly noticeable for everyone.</p><p>Martin Wagner was responsible for the construction of modern buildings in Berlin with 140,000 apartments. He worked with Bruno Taut, a visionary architect who wanted to improve the quality of life for people in cities. A basic principle of his ideas is the use of colour, of intense colours. Many houses, for example in the northern section of Fritz-Reuter-Allee and the single-family houses in the central areas, are painted dark red, blue or yellow. Leberecht Migge was the landscape architect who took care of the public facilities, private gardens and trees, which differ in the sections.</p><p>Typical for the houses of Bruno Taut and the pioneering architects of the time is that they attempt to dissolve the previously known contrast between street and courtyard, inside and outside, front and back. This means that a house can have a display facade from all sides, depending on its function and location, whether it faces the street, the courtyard, &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;.</p><p>The two main axes of the large residential area are Parchimer Allee 7-63 and Fritz-Reuter-Allee 2-120.</p><p>7 construction phases were realized between 1925 and 1933. However, only 6 construction phases, sections 1-6 have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008. Almost 2,000 apartments were built on 37 hectares. You should plan at least 2 hours for your visit, because the whole housing estate is large and varied. There are multi-family houses along the main axes and the &quot;horseshoe&quot; around the pond itself. Between the surrounding main streets (Fritz-Reuter-Allee, Parchimer-Allee, Paster-Behrens-Str., Stavenhagener Str.) there are single-family houses. The individual areas of the settlement differ greatly. Neither modern materials nor modern technology were used during the construction time. The masonry is made of brick, only standardized doors and windows and the same floor plan types reduced the costs. In the end, the financing was not enough and loans had to be taken out. That is why rents rose and instead of poorer people, who should have lived here, employees, civil servants and craftsmen moved in.</p><p>Construction phase I is located in the north between Stavenhagener Str., Fritz-Reuter-Allee and horseshoe (Hufeisen) in the south. Construction work began in 1925. The apartment buildings in the main streets all have flat roofs. The two blocks between Hufeisen and Stavenhagener Straße are painted red and delimit the settlement like a medieval city wall. The horseshoe is in the centre of the northern part. In the middle of the horseshoe is the pond. When you enter the inner courtyard of the horseshoe or see aerial photographs, you may think of an ancient theatre in its elliptical form. The opening in the complex where the staircase is located could mentally be the entrance to an ancient site whose closed form has not been preserved. The houses in this small park have terraced gardens that lead to the residential houses. On the lowest &quot;terrace&quot; there are apple trees, on the middle terrace there are cherry trees. The third terrace was not assigned an exact tree species. The gardens should be used for self-sufficiency with fruit and vegetables.</p><p>As in all three-story houses in the complex, the Hufeisen also has 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 bedroom apartments. All living rooms and kitchens that have balconies face the gardens. The apartments in the single-family houses are the largest. They have 3.5 bedrooms with a width of 5 metres or 4.5 bedrooms with a width of 6 metres. Although there are only these two house types, Taut succeeded in using the different colors (red, blue, yellow, white) and the group-wise, staggered construction, so that the streets with the single-family houses do not appear monotonous.All single-family houses in Section I, that are the streets Hüsung, Liningstr. and Miningstrasse still have pointed roofs. They show very well that Bruno Taut was familiar with historical styles and that in 1925 the principle of the classic garden city was still applied.</p><p>The Stavenhagener Str. in section I was designed by Martin Wagner. It differs because the facades facing the street are only painted white or yellow.</p><p>Section II includes Onkel-Bräsig-Str. and the area south of the horseshoe to the north side of Parchimer Allee. All houses were built in 1926 and 1927. The single-family houses correspond to those in Section 1. The three-story, white houses in Parchimer Allee separate the main street from the quiet, small streets with the single-family houses.</p><p>Sections III, IV and V from the years 1927-1929 lie to the west and are not directly connected to the remaining sections. The long blocks on Parchimer Allee, Buschkrugallee and Grüner Weg. The northern section at Buschkrugallee got the balconies at the rear. On Parchimer Allee, on the other hand, the balconies face south, i.e. the street. The southern part, south of Parchimer Allee, is called the &quot;Britzer Dreieck (the Britz triangle)&quot;. It was very unusual for modern urban planning at the time that the complex was closed like a block in the shape of a triangle.</p><p>In our view, Section VI is the most successful in terms of the aesthetics of modern construction. Bruno Taut had plans to develop an even larger area towards the south. The result is a smaller area south of Parchimer Allee, bordered by the streets Paster-Beherens-Str., Talberger Str. and Fritz-Reuter-Allee. The houses along Parchimer Allee 67-91 have three floors and are mostly painted red-white. They are the head buildings from which the narrow footpaths to the terraced houses are connected to the south. Due to money problems, the houses in this part are all built lower. On the footpaths, the terraced houses can always be reached from the east. All inhabitants walk through their garden. There are no doors on the western side. Up to Talberger Straße there are more row houses, interrupted by Gielower Straße. In contrast to the detached houses in the northern part of the settlement (construction phases I and II), all row houses have flat roofs. They are built in a direct row, without dislocations. However, Taut achieves with the colour coats of the houses that the atmosphere in section VI does not appear monotonous. In addition, all footpaths are slightly curved and do not run straight. In Gielower Str. the are standing the higher corner buildings of the footpaths of Parchimer Allee and Talberger Str. In the first two western rows the corner buildings are three storeys high. The 3 remaining corner house pairs to the east are two-storey. This creates a transition to the higher buildings in Paster-Behrens-Str. The houses in Paster-Behrens-Str. and in Fritz-Reuter-Allee 98-120 are three-storey apartment buildings with dry floors, which frame the single-family quarter in a classical way.</p><p>On the eastern edge of Fritz-Reuter Allee (No. 97-119) follows construction section VII, which was built in 1932/33. Due to lack of money only simple apartments with small flats between 32 and 45 square metres could be built. These 3 blocks do not belong to the Unesco world cultural heritage.</p><p>Building sections I-VI belong to UNESCO since 2008. The housing estate has been under monumental protection already since 1958. Since the 1980&#x27;s extensive renovations began and since 2007 the association &quot;Freunde und Förderer der Hufeisensiedlung Berlin-Britz e. V.&quot; has been advising the residents. This is because all the residents of the single-family houses are owning their houses and are responsible for the refurbishment themselves. Since the condition of the settlement was very good, many original details, such as trees, doors and windows were still present, this settlement was inscribed in the World Heritage List.</p><p>An information station (INFO STATION) with a show flat from 1925, with a short history about the housing estate and its inhabitants as well as a café is located at Fritz-Reuter-Allee 44.

    """<p>Along with the Columbus House, which no longer exists, the Metalworkers&#x27; House is one of Erich Mendelsohn&#x27;s largest projects in Berlin. Since the 1910s, more high-rise buildings were to be built in Berlin.</p><p>The German Metalworkers&#x27; Association (DMV) moved its headquarters from Stuttgart to Berlin in 1928. Mendelssohn had already gained experience, as he was drawing up plans for a trade union building in Zwickau. His experience was mainly in the construction of department stores.</p><p>The house is located on Lindenallee, which at the time the house was built was developed into a new main traffic axis to relieve the Friedrichstrasse. Mendelsohn planned urbanistically at this location, because where the houses of Lindenallee 113-116 stand today, a second building of the union was to be erected, in which the printing works were to be accommodated. A bridge over the Lindenallee was to connect the two buildings. Finally only the house on the right side of Lindenallee at the corner of Alte Jakobstraße was built.</p><p>The main building was built on a triangular site and finished in 1930. The top at the corner of Lindenallee and Alte Jakobstraße is concave, creating a small forecourt. In accordance with hierarchical principles, the offices of the board of directors were accommodated here. The highest room of the building at the main front is the meeting room, which is accentuated with a glass bay window and a flagpole. This is symbolically the command centre, almost like the place for a captain on a ship. Offices and printing houses followed on the sides. Like the shops, the printing works were located on the ground floor.</p><p>The reinforced concrete structure was built in 1929. During the construction work Mendelsohn changed the plans for the main front of the house, where the height of the Gemise was increased by 65 cm. The cladding of the building consists of shell limestone slabs that were mounted. With this he indicated that they have no load-bearing properties. Besides the shell limestone, the sliding windows have bronze frames, which gives the building a luxurious appearance. The ground floor is completely glazed. Through the entrance you enter a bright vestibule, which today houses a small exhibition about the history of the house and the architect. Mendelsohn often attached great importance to the staircases in his buildings. The staircase is located at the end of the vestibule and thus in the inner courtyard of the building. It is only from the outside that its design significance, which is almost constructivist, becomes clear. The staircase leads to the long corridors that connect the offices with the stairwell. A transverse low building in the inner courtyard was originally the print shop.</p><p>The inner courtyard without shell limestone slabs and the continuous bands of windows, arranged horizontally on all staircases and the adjacent lift shafts, arranged vertically on the corridors, plus the white-painted façade, make the inner courtyard appear more modern than the exterior façades of the building. In the inner courtyard, the building thus appears less hierarchical than the outer building.</p><p>Mendelsohn designed the new furniture for the conference room. For the administrative rooms, furniture from Stuttgart was used.</p><p>The Nazis used the building after 1933, and it was not until 1952, after war damage was repaired, that the building was returned to the IG Metall trade union. It was not until 1995 that the building underwent extensive renovation. Today the building is also the seat of the Berlin Chamber of Architects.</p>""",

<p>Although construction work did not begin until 1950, the plans date from 1947 and are based on even older basic principles of modernism in architecture. This refers to the generous functional arrangement of the building, constructed according to its use. The building was finished in 1953.</p>
<p>Since the political situation in Czechoslovakia changed in 1948, the architect's private plans were nationalised, modified, but at least implemented in accordance with his proposals. And Tenzer remained the architect of the project. A commentary from 2001 said that the building was given designations like: functionalist - cosmopolitan, contradicting the emerging tendency of Soviet teaching in all spheres in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>The polyclinic was built for workers of the industrial zones in the east of Prague (Prague 8 and Prague 9).</p>
<p>The construction of the polyclinic was difficult, because the little river Rokytka is rich in groundwater and the soil differs a lot (from moving sand up to rock) having an impact on the static conditions. Construction began with the wing closest to the river. Due to the sandy subsoil, the architect chose a foundation slab in a reinforced concrete tube, from where the foundation strips continued to the middle part of the building. The tract furthest away from the river stands on footings with pilots.</p>
<p>The building consists of a reinforced concrete construction. The inner walls are masonry, that they can be changed according to organisational and medical needs.</p>
<p>Kl&aacute;ra Pučerov&aacute; points out the functional element of noise reduction in the waiting rooms, created from four surgeries, located in the corners of an imaginary cross like square. The interior is well illuminated by natural light and easy to ventilate. Pučerov&aacute; writes, that this polyclinic features criteria typical for health centres up to a quarter century later due to the economic demands of a large monoblock and psychological impact on patients and staff.</p>

The church is located at the pointed corner in the east, representing the symbol of the ship with its prow. This easternmost point is the place of the Lord's table, the chancel of a Czechoslovak Hussitian church. The building was executed very puristically. The design dates from June 4th, 1926 and Goč&aacute;r's employee Josef Havl&iacute;ček simplified the architecture. Originally, Goč&aacute;r intended the windows to be colourful. They are now covered with glass panes. The nautical effect of the building is enhanced by the round shape of the windows. Rectangular windows have been installed in the western part of the church to allow ventilation. Adopted from industrial buildings, the opening and closing of these windows is made possible by a gear wheel and chains. The side areas of the church are flatter, pierced by pillars that support the high church walls. The side areas of the church are structurally a continuation of the outer perimeter of the site. On the gallery in the west is placed the organ. The lamps are original. A new, but also artistically valuable piece of art is the cross made of laminate by the artist Maxim Velčovsk&yacute; in 2002.

    """<p>Some authors mention it as housing estate Zwenkau. That is why we have adopted the term. However, only one block was realised. It is situated in a south-north direction. It has seven entrances. Three of them (No. 13, 17, 21) are facing the street Goethestra&szlig;e on the east side, three further entrances (No. 15, 19, 23) are facing the courtyard on the west side. On the east and west sides are attached three protruding staircases each, laid out alternately. There is always a "front and rear entrance" for each entrance. Next to the staircases, the architect designed round windows. Behind them are located the bathrooms. The position of the bathroom windows and staircases of the <a id="78"></a><a href="https://modernism-in-architecture.org/buildings/housing-estate-galgenberg/">housing estate Galgenberg in Gera</a> was designed in the same way. At the point of the block where staircases have not been fitted (the "rear entrances") and rows of loggias on the first and second floors are accentuating the facade. To left and right of all "rear entrances" are located benches made of concrete as a social corner for the tenants. The block's rhythm is also influenced by the pairs of windows, indicating one flat behind each pair.</p>
<p>The entrance with the number 25 is located in the north and it was built as an independent building. The glazing of the staircase is particularly striking, a trademark of the architect also used for all other staircases of this block. This front building was originally planned as a caf&eacute;. Since the "settlement" was to be extended by one more building to the west, the northern side of the block was given this design, intending to mark the entrance to the settlement.</p>
<p>The basement of the block is made of cement concrete, the rest of the building is masoned. The facade is decorated alternately with clinker and plaster.</p>
<p>Each floor has two flats. The flats on the first, second and third floor have three rooms: a bathroom, kitchen and anteroom, which are arranged mirror-inverted in relation to the neighbouring flat. The result is, that no side was given a functional significance, so that there are bedrooms and living rooms on all sides.</p>
<p>The flats on the third floor were smaller, as they had roof terraces on the east side. These were converted into living spaces in between 1974-76. This conversion is clearly visible today because of the "ribbon windows".</p>
<p>The flats on the 1st until the 3rd floor of the main block have an area of 56 square metres, the ground floor flats have 30 square metres, and the two flats in No. 25 have flats with 87 square metres.</p>
<p>The kitchens were equipped with a single-burner kitchen, a space-saving folding table and a gas cooker, and the pantries had external ventilation. The entire block used one central heating. The distinctive chimney between house no. 23 and 25 still exists.</p>

The large glazing allows a high incidence of light, another premise of the new architectural tasks of the 1920s. In the place of today's glazing was placed an open area that was used as a terrace and rooms behind as playrooms. In warm weather, the windows could be opened completely. To both sides of the central part are attached sun terraces with conrete awnings. Stairs are leading from there the sports field. Both the main entrance and the semicircular part of the building feature the typical Goč&aacute;r round pillars. For the construction was used reinforced concrete with load-bearing brick walls.

The wall to the flat is always set back on the right-hand side, making the balcony shape triangular. A kind of lattice serves as a railing.

The whole is finished by a combination of flat roofs with a slightly projecting roof edge. Standing brown brick masonry with horizontal and vertical articulation on an undulating natural stone base with bossed blocks and wrought iron railings at the bent transitions. The windows above the base have sandstone frames. The symmetrically designed NW facade with its prominent rounded corners on Roelof Hartplein has thirteen bays. The north wing and part of the south wing are mirror images of each other. However, the longer south wing - with post office - is more substantial and extends further with two facades on Gerard Terborgstraat. Thus, the building consists of five facades on the different sides of the street. The tall square bell tower with narrow windows in the masonry and with four dials and natural stone cladding is located in the northern side wing. The northern and southern side wings eventually connect to the residential buildings on Roelof Hartstraat and Gerard Terborgstraat, respectively.<br /><br />On the inside of the U-shaped building block, centered behind the main building, is the conservatory-like extension of the former residents' dining room. This addition consists of a rectangular structure and a five-sided apse. The rear facades have simple windows with transoms or pivot windows, and some have balconies with French doors. The NE facade on the Roelof Hartstraat side has four storefronts on the first floor. The middle part of the wing is raised.

The central section is three window axes wide and has bay windows on the ground and second floors. On the second floor these have a multi-pane link window infill. The second floor has a balcony with a brick parapet. The fifth and sixth floors of the central section are set back. On both sides, the facade is flanked by circular risalites, each with two narrower circular siderisals on a high natural stone base. These contain the central entrances, behind which are the central halls, curved window sections, natural stone accents, and a taller, rounded central section with narrow windows and a flagpole. The adjacent fa&ccedil;ade on the south side has two storefronts on the first floor with stained glass windows in the tall clerestory windows. The rest of the articulation and division is much the same as the NE fa&ccedil;ade. The facade of the south wing widens further into Gerard Terborgstraat after an in-and-out sculptural corner section. The brick parapets of the balconies on the first and second floors are continuous in the plane of the facade and also extend over the rest of the wing facade.<br /><br />On the first floor is the central entrance to the bike shed. Glazed floor slabs with rectangular glass blocks were installed to expose the basement areas. The attic is set back and has a gallery. The easternmost section of the south wing has the wide post office windows on the first floor. The sandstone mullions rest on the natural stone lintel. The window infill is further divided by steel bars. The entrance to the post office is on the right side. There are rocker windows at the top of the windows. The facade is recessed on the first, third and fifth floors. The gable ends with a sculptural rounded pediment on the right side. The simple windows are balanced in different types across the facade.<br /><br />The wooden ceiling in the dining room and adjoining rooms is original, as are the doors and the partition between the respective dining rooms. The apartments are grouped on both sides of long corridors. Staircases with expressionist railings and windows with stained glass panels connect the floors. The central staircases emanate from two central halls in the Roelof Hartplein section of the building. These halls also have marble floors and wooden entrance doors and paneling.<br /><br />Inside Gerard Terborgstraat No. 46, some parts of the original furnishings of the post office on this side have been preserved: the tiled floor, the stained-glass paneling of the interior skylights, the wooden revolving door lock, and some panel doors.</p>

The entrance of the house with a canopy is orientated towards the southwest.

<p>Added to the building is the semi-circular bay window or avant-corps at the corner, trying to make its effect in the narrow alleys. The ribbon windows are of great advantage, as they allow as much light as possible to fall inside the building. On Provaznick&aacute; Street, the fourth and fifth floors are set back in steps and each of the two floors has a terrace. Because the fifth floor has been set back so far at this point, the round area of the oriel looks like a house's tower.<br />The house does not have a courtyard, as this area is very narrowly built.</p>
<p>The building is named "Three Farmers" after the previous building. Its house sign, showing three farmers, has been preserved and reattached to this building at Provaznick&aacute; Street. Engraved on a little plaque under the sign is the date 1794 and the name <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mal%C3%ADnsk%C3%BD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josef Mal&iacute;nsk&yacute;</a>, who was most likely the sculptor.

<p>All terraced houses and semi-detached houses in the T&ouml;rten housing estate are designed as single-family houses with three different types. They all consist of a reinforced concrete skeleton and masonry concrete bricks. All 314 houses on plots of 350-400 square metres have a garden, used for growing one's own vegetables and for keeping small farm animals.<br />The first type was built in 1926, called siet&ouml; I. The Anton house in the street Doppelreihe 35 has been preserved almost in its original condition and is now open to the public on guided tours, to see how those houses looked like. They were always designed as a kind of semi-detached house. A firewall divides the two buildings. This wall only started at the level of the window sill on the ground floor.<br />Inside, the living room faced the street and the kitchen faced the garden. Behind the kitchen was located a stable with a toilet in it. The design of the kitchen and the combination of the toilet within the stable raise the question whether Gropius was indeed a great architect? Maybe he was it for public buildings, but probably less for residential buildings. A staircase leads to the upper floor with another room facing the street and two rooms facing the garden. The terrace is situated above the stable. In total, the flats have 75 square metres of living space and a cellar, which makes them very generously designed.<br />Due to criticism of the siet&ouml; I type, especially that it was too narrow, the siet&ouml; II type was built in 1927. It is about two metres wider and has a living space of 70 square metres. By changing the room arrangement, however, it was even possible to gain one more room on the ground floor. The characteristic feature of this type is the zigzag course. The entrance doors with the hallway, staircase and vertical ribbon windows are located at the deeper cuts. The living rooms are located at the more protruding sections. Otherwise, these houses correspond very closely to the siet&ouml; I type.<br />The last construction phase took place in 1928 and brought with it the siet&ouml; IV building type. Due to cost-cutting constraints, the living space was reduced to 57 square metres and Gropius avoided to complete a full stairway. Instead, two short stairs lead from the ground floor level either the suterrain or to the first floor. These houses do not have cellars.</p>

It would be typical for a garden city to have more footpaths running the gardens to make them visible for visitors. The gardens of this housing estate are more visible from the street.

Only four flats had 4 1&frasl;2 rooms.

In the street Erich-Weinert-Stra&szlig;e, dividing the housing estate into a north and a south half, no connecting structures were added, creating opened courtyards. Originally, these inner areas were designed park-like with hedges as boundaries. After World War II until the 1990s, the residents started to use the courtyards as gardens, of which unfortunately only a few remain today and the park-like, somewhat boring character dominates again.<br />All courtyards have a different colour, as a kind of orientation aid. The western courtyards are painted green, the central courtyards blue and the eastern courtyards red. The windows are painted in Bruno Taut's typical colours of yellow, blue, red, white and/or black, and the doors are also in different colour schemes, either in yellow, green, red or blue.<br />All the balconies in the complex face the inner courtyards, resulting that an equal number of balconies face north-east and south-west.

The backward facade in &Scaron;irok&aacute; Street was provided with double casement windows. It is precisely this window arrangement that differs from the other facade in Dr. Stejskala Street, designed with ribbon windows. Hopper windows were often used for the Brouk + Babka department stores. For the presentation of the various goods, the windows have been designed large for an optimal lighting of the interior. The shelves were often arranged under the ribbon windows at B+B. We have no information whether this function was used in exactly the same way in this house, but we assume it.<br />Like many buildings of the 1920s and 1930s in Česk&eacute; Budějovice, the construction of arcaded sidewalks on the ground floor, which are very typical for the city, were not used for the new construction. This marked a hard break in the local building tradition.</p>
<p>The facade is cladded with beige ceramic tiles, made by Zapadočesk&eacute; kaolinky in Horn&iacute; Bř&iacute;za, Czechia. As long as the tiles remain intact, this has the advantage over plaster that the facade does not need to be renovated for a long time.</p>
<p>Since the centre and the blocks of houses in the centre of Česk&eacute; Budějovice are built closely to each other, this house does not have a courtyard or a designed rear facade.&nbsp;</p>""",

Several projecting and receding parts of the facade give the house its rhythm and are intended to refer to the different functions of rooms. The ground floor was once also reserved for representative functions, while the family's living quarters were located on the two upper floors.<br />Individual window zones soften the heaviness of the house, such as the ribbon window of the staircase at the entrance or horizontal ribbon windows on the garden side. The entrance was particularly emphasised by tapering the stairs towards the top and thus leading the view into the house. A canopy has been stretched over the stairs in a very stately manner. On the garden side, a terrace and pergola complement the architecture of the house and lead into the garden as light contructions.
