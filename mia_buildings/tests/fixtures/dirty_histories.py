    """<p>The housing estate Krochsiedlung in the north of Leipzig was planned in 1928 with 4500 flats for up to 15,000 tenants. It would have become the largest housing estate in the time of Weimar Republic. Additionally were planned a central square, a school and a social centre, but none of these were realised.</p>
<p>Famous architects of Berlin modernism, such as <a id="115"></a><a href="https://modernism-in-architecture.org/people/architects/otto-rudolf-salvisberg/">Otto Rudolf Salvisberg</a>, were asked to do the planning. Even Le Corbusier was addressed, but he declined.</p>
<p>The first prize won the architectural office Mebes &amp; Emmerlich from Berlin. Together with the architects Max Fricke, Johannes Koppe and Adolf Muesmann they designed the housing estate.</p>
<p>A major shareholder of the developer company A.-G. f&uuml;r Haus und Wohnbesitz was Hans Kroch, which is why the settlement is called Krochsiedlung and its official name, Wohnstadt der A.-G. f&uuml;r Haus und Wohnbesitz is never mentioned. Hans Kroch determined that the work begun in September 1929 would have to be stopped in the autumn of 1930 due to the world economic crisis. In the end, the developer "Leipziger A.-G. f&uuml;r Haus- und Grundbesitz im Norden" built less houses.</p>

<p>With the modernisations from 1991 to 2000, the windows with wooden frames were replaced by plastic-framed windows and the facades were insulated. It was no attention paid to the aesthetics of the original architecture. Especially the choice of plastic cladding on the loggias is detrimental to the architecture. The loggias can be seen as an architectural dominance of the houses. Their inferiority lowers the value of the architecture of these houses.</p>
<p>In 2020, a construction project called "Kroch-Quartier" began to the east of the settlement with two houses that roughly adopt the design features of the Krochsiedlung. They stand on the site where the continuation of the settlement in an easterly direction was originally planned.</p>""",

The authors rightly note that in Czechoslovakia, functionalist architecture was a kind of state architecture in areas with a Czech-speaking population. In the former German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia, i.e. a large part of the border areas like Varnsdorf, the administrations and clients were rather sceptical towards architecture of an international format. So it was very difficult for the developer Eltis to get a building permit for this house with a flat roof from the town council Varnsdorf. Since the client was a lawyer, he knew how to help himself, filed an objection against the town council at the regional government authority in Prague and won. The government authority explained the beauty of the "modern" architecture to the Varnsdorf town council. This can certainly be understood as a kind of side blow by a Czech authority against a (conservatively minded) German-speaking authority of those years.</p>
