                        <p>
                            We are <a href="https://osthorizonte.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Dietze</a> and <a href="https://normade.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norma Driske</a> from Leipzig, Germany. 
                            Two friends with a passion for an <strong>architectural style</strong> called <strong>Modernism in architecture</strong>. 
                            A style that emerged in the interwar-period between the 1920s and 1940s.

                        <p>
                            For quite a while it had been the regular habit that Norma (being a programmer with almost no knowledge of architecture beyond that of software) kept asking 
                            Frank (being an art historian and professional tour leader with all the knowledge of 
                            architecture except that of software) about <strong>facts and contexts of places and modernist buildings</strong> we visited during our trips and walks. And Frank always had the good answers that Norma 
                            unfortunately couldn‚Äôt remember for long ;-) 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>So we came up with the idea to <strong>merge our skills and persist the knowledge</strong> of Frank in a medium Norma can build and that can be 
                            visited again and again... <br><strong>MIA - modernism-in-architecture.org</strong> was born and we collect on this page our pics and knowledge for everyone out there who shares our 
                            passion for this interesting architectural period (and for those who have a memory lack like Norma).
